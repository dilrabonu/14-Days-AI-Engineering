Learning AI Engineering deeply


14-Day AI Voice Engineering Roadmap (Updated & Professional)
✅ Tools Covered: Python, Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Silero, FastAPI, LiveKit, Docker, Streamlit, gRPC, Hugging Face, Librosa
📅 Day 1: Foundations of AI Engineering & Voice AI
🎓 Theory:

What is AI Engineering? Roles vs ML Engineering vs Data Science

Core concepts of Speech AI: STT, TTS, VAD, NLP

👨‍💻 Practice:

Set up environment (venv, GitHub, Jupyter/Colab, Docker installed)

📦 Project: Create a project folder & GitHub repo: voice-agent-pro

📅 Day 2: Digital Audio & Signal Processing with Python
🎓 Theory:

Sampling, noise, MFCCs, spectrograms

👨‍💻 Practice:

Visualize your voice using librosa, matplotlib, scipy

📦 Project: Create waveform/spectrogram plots of 2 voice samples

📅 Day 3: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) with Silero
🎓 Theory:

What is VAD and why it's essential for real-time audio

👨‍💻 Practice:

Use silero-vad to detect and trim silence from .wav files

📦 Project: Build a Python module to extract speech from raw audio

📅 Day 4: Deepgram STT - Introduction & API Setup
🎓 Theory:

Deepgram’s architecture, accuracy, and real-time support

👨‍💻 Practice:

Get API key → Transcribe .wav files using deepgram-sdk

📦 Project: Build CLI: input audio → output transcript

📅 Day 5: Deepgram STT - Advanced Usage & Evaluation
🎓 Theory:

Error metrics: WER, CER, latency, accuracy

👨‍💻 Practice:

Benchmark STT on noisy vs clean audio

📦 Project: Save metrics for 3 different recordings in .csv

📅 Day 6: ElevenLabs TTS - Introduction & API Integration
🎓 Theory:

Neural TTS, prosody, speaker identity, emotion modeling

👨‍💻 Practice:

Use elevenlabs API: Text → Natural Audio

📦 Project: Input: string → Output: TTS .mp3

📅 Day 7: Build Your Core Voice Agent Pipeline (CLI)
🎓 Combine: Silero VAD + Deepgram STT + ElevenLabs TTS

👨‍💻 Practice:

Build CLI: record mic → VAD → STT → LLM Response → TTS

📦 Project: Test it on 3 sample conversations

📅 Day 8: API Development with FastAPI
🎓 Theory:

What is an ML API? REST vs gRPC, FastAPI vs Flask

👨‍💻 Practice:

Create a FastAPI app: POST .wav → Deepgram STT → return transcript

📦 Project: Host STT API locally

📅 Day 9: Real-time Agent Framework with LiveKit (Part 1)
🎓 Theory:

LiveKit architecture, WebRTC, low-latency audio streaming

👨‍💻 Practice:

Set up a simple LiveKit voice channel

📦 Project: Integrate your mic as LiveKit audio input

📅 Day 10: Real-time Agent with Deepgram & ElevenLabs (Part 2)
🎓 Flow:

LiveKit Mic → Silero (VAD) → Deepgram (STT) → GPT → ElevenLabs (TTS) → LiveKit Output

👨‍💻 Practice:

Connect endpoints via Python

📦 Project: Live conversation: "How's the weather?" → TTS reply

📅 Day 11: Text Generation with GPT for Smart Responses
🎓 Theory:

GPT, prompt engineering, fine-tuning

👨‍💻 Practice:

Add GPT (via OpenAI or Hugging Face) for contextual replies

📦 Project: Voice assistant with memory ("Who am I?")

📅 Day 12: Docker + Deployment Best Practices
🎓 Theory:

Why Docker? Containerization for ML APIs

👨‍💻 Practice:

Dockerize your STT FastAPI app

📦 Project: Push to DockerHub

📅 Day 13: Streamlit Interface for Your Voice Agent
🎓 Theory:

Streamlit vs Gradio vs Flask UI

👨‍💻 Practice:

Create a clean UI: record voice → view transcript → hear reply

📦 Project: Add to your GitHub & prepare for demo

📅 Day 14: Final Deployment & Portfolio Polish
✅ Test all: Silero + Deepgram + GPT + ElevenLabs + LiveKit

✅ Host: Hugging Face Spaces (or Render)

✅ Write GitHub README + Notion documentation

✅ Write LinkedIn post: “I built my own AI Voice Agent in 14 days!” 🚀
