14-Day AI Voice Engineering Roadmap
Day 1: Introduction to AI Engineering & Voice AI
🎓 AI Engineering vs Data Science

🎓 Overview of Voice AI systems: STT, TTS, VAD

👨‍💻 Python setup (virtualenv, Jupyter, Colab)

📦 Task: Create a Notion board to track daily tasks

Day 2: Digital Signal Processing Basics
🎓 Sampling, frequency, spectrograms, MFCCs

👨‍💻 Use librosa, scipy, and matplotlib to visualize voice signals

📦 Task: Plot a waveform & spectrogram of your voice

Day 3: Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
🎓 What is VAD? Use-cases in real-time systems

🎓 Intro to Silero VAD (lightweight, real-time)

👨‍💻 Code with silero-vad and segment an audio file

📦 Task: Save only the speech parts from a noisy audio file

Day 4: Speech-to-Text (STT) Overview
🎓 STT pipeline (preprocessing, model, decoding)

🎓 Models: DeepSpeech vs Wav2Vec2 vs Whisper

👨‍💻 Run Wav2Vec2 from Hugging Face on sample audio

📦 Task: Convert a .wav file to text using pretrained Wav2Vec2

Day 5: Advanced STT with Whisper
🎓 Why Whisper by OpenAI is state-of-the-art

👨‍💻 Transcribe multilingual audio with openai-whisper

📦 Task: Transcribe English + Uzbek speech file

Day 6: Comparing STT Models
🎓 Comparison: Accuracy, inference time, model size

👨‍💻 Benchmark Whisper vs Wav2Vec2 on the same file

📦 Task: Build a simple STT evaluation script

Day 7: Mid-Project Checkpoint
🎓 Review core concepts: VAD + STT

👨‍💻 Mini-project: Real-time audio recording → VAD → STT

📦 Task: Build a CLI tool: Record and transcribe voice

Day 8: Introduction to Text-to-Speech (TTS)
🎓 TTS overview: Tacotron2, FastSpeech, Glow-TTS

🎓 Intro to vocoders: Griffin-Lim, WaveGlow, HiFi-GAN

👨‍💻 Use TTS by coqui-ai or espnet to convert text to speech

📦 Task: Convert text input into audio with a pre-trained model

Day 9: Real-Time TTS with Silero
🎓 Why Silero TTS is used in real-time applications

👨‍💻 Use Silero TTS to convert Uzbek/English text

📦 Task: Create a simple Python app: Input text → MP3 output

Day 10: Build TTS-STT Conversational Loop
🎓 Design a pipeline: TTS → User speaks → STT

👨‍💻 Build the app in Python using Whisper + Silero

📦 Task: Create a basic voice assistant

Day 11: Fine-Tuning & Custom Voice Models
🎓 Dataset creation: Common Voice, LJSpeech, custom data

🎓 Basics of fine-tuning STT/TTS models

👨‍💻 Load and prepare your custom dataset

📦 Task: Start preparing your voice samples for fine-tuning

Day 12: Model Deployment Concepts
🎓 Serving ML models: Flask, FastAPI, Docker, gRPC

👨‍💻 Serve your STT pipeline with FastAPI

📦 Task: Build an API that receives .wav file and returns text

Day 13: Realtime Voice Agent with Streamlit
🎓 Integrating TTS + STT into a Streamlit app

👨‍💻 Build a Streamlit app: Speak → Transcribe → Reply with voice

📦 Task: Build a UI for your AI voice assistant

Day 14: Final Project & Showcase
👨‍💻 Combine everything:

VAD + STT (Whisper)

TTS (Silero)

Streamlit/FastAPI for interface

📦 Task: Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces or Render

🎓 Bonus: Create a GitHub README + LinkedIn Post

📚 RECOMMENDED RESOURCES
Hugging Face Models: Whisper, Wav2Vec2, Silero, ESPNet, TTS

Datasets: Common Voice, LJSpeech
